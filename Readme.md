<h3>Description</h3>

<p>To achieve this, you needed to drop an <strong>XRLabel</strong> onto the band where you want page numbers to be shown (for instance, <strong>Page Footer</strong>), then handle its <strong>PrintOnPage</strong> event and use the following code. Note that here the <strong>lastID</strong> variable  serves as an indicator for the value by which the report&#39;s data is grouped. In your scenario you should use another variable, which implements your variant of grouping. Note also that for this example to work in earlier versions of XtraReports, you should bind the label&#39;s <strong>Tag</strong> property to a data field, which serves as a group field.</p>
